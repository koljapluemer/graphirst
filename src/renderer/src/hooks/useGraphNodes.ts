 * Bridges the derived view (buildView) and React Flow's own node state.
 *
 * React Flow owns `nodes` via `useNodesState`, so a drag mutates only the dragged
 * node in place - no per-frame rebuild of the whole array. A `useEffect`
 * re-derives the view whenever a layout / graph / pin / interaction input changes
 * (never during a drag). The view is structurally shared with the previous one,
 * so only nodes whose view actually changed are handed to React Flow as new
 * objects - everything else keeps its identity, its measured size and its
 * memoized render. This is React Flow's recommended shape for a flow whose nodes
 * also come from external data (see reactflow.dev/api-reference/hooks/use-nodes-state).
